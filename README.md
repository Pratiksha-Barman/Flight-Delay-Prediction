# Flight Delay Prediction Using Machine Learning Model

The project aims to build a machine learning model, that aims to predict the flights being delayed at John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK). The goal is to manage crowded situations at airports, which cause financial difficulties for the airline industry.

## Data Source

The model is fed with the data collected from John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) over a one-year period, from November 2019 to December 2020.

The data set is sourced from Kaggle: [JFK Flight Take-Off Data](https://www.kaggle.com/deepankurk/flight-take-off-data-jfk-airport).

## Models

The flight delay prediction is performed using two algorithms:
1. **Decision Tree Algorithm**
2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm**

A flight is considered delayed if it departs 15 minutes later than the scheduled departure time.

## Results

The results of both models are compared and visualized. The plots show the performance of each model in predicting flight delays.
